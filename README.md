# NovusNet
Forget wrestling with raw sockets or drowning in Boost.Asio boilerplate. NovusNet gets a server and client talking in less than 10 lines of code. Built for for indie devs, beginners, and anyone who's project doesn't need the overkill of larger libraries and the complexity they bring.
# WARNING
- Any connection is not encrypted yet, expose this code to the internet at your own risk.
- This is still in super early development, expect occasional bugs, and make sure to report said bugs to me.
- As of right now, NovusNet servers can only handle 1 client at a time, don't expect much.
- No Windows support exists yet, this is mainly for Linux systems, I'll add Windows support when the Linux version is truly stable.
# Why I made this
Learning sockets as a beginner is rough. The setup is long, 
the errors are annoying, and even once you get it, you still have 
to do it all over again every new project.

NovusNet exists so you don't have to struggle. Whether you're just starting 
out with networking or you're an experienced dev who doesn't want 
to write boilerplate for the hundredth time, NovusNet handles the 
setup so you can focus on actually building.

# Code examples
## Server

```cpp
#include"nn.hpp"
#include<iostream>
#include<chrono>
int main(){
    runServer(9090);
    while(true){
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
    }
    return 0;
}
```
## Client
```cpp
#include "nn.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    std::string msg;
    //runClient(ip,port) connects to a server
    runClient("127.0.0.1", 9090);
    while(true){
        std::getline(std::cin,msg);
        //sendMsg(string msg) sends data as a string
        sendMsg(msg);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

 - These same snippets can be found at **src/client.cpp** and **src/server.cpp**
 # Installation
- Just clone the repo with "git clone ..."
- Copy the "include/nn.hpp" file into your own include file.
- Copy the "src/nn.cpp" file into your own src file.
- Add line **#include"nn.hpp"** at the top of your main.cpp
- Don't forget to include the new files in your CMakeLists.txt if you have one:

```cpp
add_executable(PROJECTNAME
    src/main.cpp
    src/nn.cpp
)
target_include_directories(PROJECTNAME PRIVATE include)
```
